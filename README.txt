SW search web app

# The project has first page as login page where you can enter username and password from swapi.co users. for example
Username- Luke Skywalker
password- 19BBY
The second page is home page which displays all the planets. The planets are displayed using different div sizes acording to the population

# The search filter works with the planet name. 
#If user other than Luke Skywalker performs search more than 15 times in a minute then the serach is disabled for them.

#Sample test case is added for HomeController file and PlanetService file.

#We can also integrate chart.js for displaying different planets.. Not done in this build but it is possible and will implement if needed.
